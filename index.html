				What if you could increase railway capacity without modifying operational practices and/or adding new infrastructure?<br>
				<br>
				What if you could double the number of passengers while reducing the number of trains?<br>
				<br>
				What if all that was possible while reducing ecological footprint by providing sustainable transport to millions of passengers?<br>
				<br>
				DirecTrainS is developing a novel rail technology, designed to solve to existing delays and congestion problems.<br>
				It will offer unstoppable, direct railway system applicable anywhere, anytime.
